`fbxctest` is required to run UI tests directly from Buck. It needs to be updated when moving to a new Xcode version. To do ths, [follow the instructions in the Buck repostiory](https://github.com/facebook/buck/tree/master/test/com/facebook/buck/apple/testdata/fbxctest).

Furthermore, `fbxctest` needs additional shims to enable it to control the Simulator. Those are `libShimulator.dylib` and `libMaculator.dylib`. They are not part of `fbxctest` by default, but can be obtained from [the FBSimulatorControl repository](https://github.com/facebook/FBSimulatorControl/tree/master/Shims). After downloading them, place the dynamic libraries in the `fbxctest/lib` directory.
