     @discussion The app extension has the option of capturing its private state as an NSUserActivity and returning it as the 'currentActivity'. If the app is launched, an NSUserActivity will be passed in with the private state. The NSUserActivity may also be used to query the app's UI extension (if provided) for a view controller representing the current intent handling state. In the case of app launch, the NSUserActivity will have its activityType set to the name of the intent. This intent object will also be available in the NSUserActivity.interaction property.

     @param  code The response code indicating your success or failure in confirming or handling the intent.
     @param  userActivity The user activity object to use when launching your app. Provide an object if you want to add information that is specific to your app. If you specify nil, the system automatically creates a user activity object for you, sets its type to the class name of the intent being handled, and fills it with an INInteraction object containing the intent and your response.
