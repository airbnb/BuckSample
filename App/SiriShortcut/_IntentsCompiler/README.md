# IntentsCompiler Xcode Project

`IntentDefinitionCodegen` is internal to Xcode. As such, Apple does not expose a standalone command for creating the Swift (or Objective-C) interface from an .intentdefinition.

Airbnb has filed a Radar requesting this functionality.

Until then, we are using this Xcode project to generate code from the .intentdefinition.
