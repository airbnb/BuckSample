/** Callback for filter operations.
 *
 * @param filteredReports The filtered reports (may be incomplete if "completed"
 *                        is false).
 * @param completed True if filtering completed.
 *                  Can be false due to a non-erroneous condition (such as a
 *                  user cancelling the operation).
 * @param error Non-nil if an error occurred.
